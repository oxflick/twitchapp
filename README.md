<h1> Twith TV App </h1>

<p> In this project I focused to display the set of streamers from Twitch API by utilizing getJSON and iterating tru objects. </p>

<p> The App shows streamers with indication if any of them broadcasts at the moment. If they do, you can see the additional details about what they are streaming. </p>

<p> User can click on the name and be sent directly to the channel. </p>

<p> User can also see a notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). </p>

<p> This is JavaScript and jQuery project </p>
